This adaptation tries to exapnd upon and incorporate many of the lesson learned through
the post graduate certificate at Sussex University, United Kingdom.

This version attempts to successfully add interaction with items, implement a GUI so no
typed commands are required and implement a log so that a record of player movements 
and actions are recorded.

To start this application, create an instance of class "Game" and call its
"play" method.
